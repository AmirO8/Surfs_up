# Summary
Considering June is summer month and December is a winter month their average temperatures were only seperatd by 3.91째. That is a good sign as it seems that you can surf year round. The next data point I would like to see is the percipitation. I can assume that no one wants to go surfing and have ice-cream when it is raining. Adjusting the initial query we can use the following: 
 - december_rain = session.query(Measurement.prcp).filter( extract('month', Measurement.date) == '12')
 - june_rain = session.query(Measurement.prcp).filter( extract('month', Measurement.date) == '06')
 
 Below are the results:
